### Description
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics regularly makes available data on the number of vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians crossing into the United States by land.

For this challenge, I needed to create an application that calculates the total number of times vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians cross the U.S.-Canadian and U.S.-Mexican borders each month. Also, the app needs to calculate the running monthly average of total number of crossings for that type of crossing and border.

### Instructions

App requires [Python] (https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.7+ to run.

NOTE:
if your machine runs Windows To execute the application in Windows

In the command line type:
```sh
$ cd <app_root_dir>
$ run.sh
```
